For example, the filters `Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS CloudWatch` match a finding that includes either `CloudFront` , `CloudWatch` , or both strings in the title.
         *
         * To search for values that don’t have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:
         *
         * - To search for values that exclude the filter value, use `NOT_CONTAINS` . For example, the filter `Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront` matches findings that have a `Title` that excludes the string CloudFront.
         * - To search for values other than the filter value, use `NOT_EQUALS` . For example, the filter `AwsAccountId NOT_EQUALS 123456789012` only matches findings that have an account ID other than `123456789012` .
         * - To search for values that don't start with the filter value, use `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` . For example, the filter `ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS us` matches findings with a `ResourceRegion` that starts with a value other than `us` .
         *
         * `NOT_CONTAINS` , `NOT_EQUALS` , and `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters on the same field are joined by `AND` . A finding matches only if it matches all of those filters. For example, the filters `Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch` match a finding that excludes both `CloudFront` and `CloudWatch` in the title.
         *
         * You can’t have both a `CONTAINS` filter and a `NOT_CONTAINS` filter on the same field. Similarly, you can't provide both an `EQUALS` filter and a `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filter on the same field. Combining filters in this way returns an error. `CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `CONTAINS` filters. `NOT_CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `NOT_CONTAINS` filters.
         *
         * You can combine `PREFIX` filters with `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters for the same field. Security Hub first processes the `PREFIX` filters, and then the `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters.
         *
         * For example, for the following filters, Security Hub first identifies findings that have resource types that start with either `AwsIam` or `AwsEc2` . It then excludes findings that have a resource type of `AwsIamPolicy` and findings that have a resource type of `AwsEc2NetworkInterface` .
         *
         * - `ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam`
         * - `ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2`
         * - `ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy`
         * - `ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface`
         *
         * `CONTAINS` and `NOT_CONTAINS` operators can be used only with automation rules. For more information, see [Automation rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/automation-rules.html) in the *AWS Security Hub User Guide* .

         * `CONTAINS` and `EQUALS` filters on the same field are joined by `OR` . A finding matches if it matches any one of those filters.

         *
         * - To search for values that include the filter value, use `CONTAINS` . For example, the filter `Title CONTAINS CloudFront` matches findings that have a `Title` that includes the string CloudFront.
         * - To search for values that exactly match the filter value, use `EQUALS` . For example, the filter `AwsAccountId EQUALS 123456789012` only matches findings that have an account ID of `123456789012` .
         * - To search for values that start with the filter value, use `PREFIX` . For example, the filter `ResourceRegion PREFIX us` matches findings that have a `ResourceRegion` that starts with `us` . A `ResourceRegion` that starts with a different value, such as `af` , `ap` , or `ca` , doesn't match.
         *
         * `CONTAINS` , `EQUALS` , and `PREFIX` filters on the same field are joined by `OR` . A finding matches if it matches any one of those filters. For example, the filters `Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS CloudWatch` match a finding that includes either `CloudFront` , `CloudWatch` , or both strings in the title.
         *
         * To search for values that don’t have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:
         *
         * - To search for values that exclude the filter value, use `NOT_CONTAINS` . For example, the filter `Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront` matches findings that have a `Title` that excludes the string CloudFront.
         * - To search for values other than the filter value, use `NOT_EQUALS` . For example, the filter `AwsAccountId NOT_EQUALS 123456789012` only matches findings that have an account ID other than `123456789012` .
         * - To search for values that don't start with the filter value, use `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` . For example, the filter `ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS us` matches findings with a `ResourceRegion` that starts with a value other than `us` .
         *
         * `NOT_CONTAINS` , `NOT_EQUALS` , and `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters on the same field are joined by `AND` . A finding matches only if it matches all of those filters. For example, the filters `Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch` match a finding that excludes both `CloudFront` and `CloudWatch` in the title.
         *
         * You can’t have both a `CONTAINS` filter and a `NOT_CONTAINS` filter on the same field. Similarly, you can't provide both an `EQUALS` filter and a `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filter on the same field. Combining filters in this way returns an error. `CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `CONTAINS` filters. `NOT_CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `NOT_CONTAINS` filters.
         *
         * You can combine `PREFIX` filters with `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters for the same field. Security Hub first processes the `PREFIX` filters, and then the `NOT_EQUALS` or `PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS` filters.
         *
         * For example, for the following filters, Security Hub first identifies findings that have resource types that start with either `AwsIam` or `AwsEc2` . It then excludes findings that have a resource type of `AwsIamPolicy` and findings that have a resource type of `AwsEc2NetworkInterface` .
         *
         * - `ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam`
         * - `ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2`
         * - `ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy`
         * - `ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface`
         *
         * `CONTAINS` and `NOT_CONTAINS` operators can be used only with automation rules. For more information, see [Automation rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/automation-rules.html) in the *AWS Security Hub User Guide* .

For example, for the `ResourceTags` field, the filter `Department CONTAINS Security` matches findings that include the value `Security` for the `Department` tag. In the same example, a finding with a value of `Security team` for the `Department` tag is a match.
         * - To search for values that exactly match the filter value, use `EQUALS` . For example, for the `ResourceTags` field, the filter `Department EQUALS Security` matches findings that have the value `Security` for the `Department` tag.
         *
         * `CONTAINS` and `EQUALS` filters on the same field are joined by `OR` . A finding matches if it matches any one of those filters.

         * - To search for values that exclude the filter value, use `NOT_CONTAINS` . For example, for the `ResourceTags` field, the filter `Department NOT_CONTAINS Finance` matches findings that exclude the value `Finance` for the `Department` tag.
         * - To search for values other than the filter value, use `NOT_EQUALS` . For example, for the `ResourceTags` field, the filter `Department NOT_EQUALS Finance` matches findings that don’t have the value `Finance` for the `Department` tag.
         *
         * `NOT_CONTAINS` and `NOT_EQUALS` filters on the same field are joined by `AND` . A finding matches only if it matches all of those filters. For example, the filters `Department NOT_CONTAINS Security AND Department NOT_CONTAINS Finance` match a finding that excludes both the `Security` and `Finance` values.
         *
         * `CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `CONTAINS` filters. `NOT_CONTAINS` filters can only be used with other `NOT_CONTAINS` filters.

         * You can’t have both a `CONTAINS` filter and a `NOT_CONTAINS` filter on the same field. Similarly, you can’t have both an `EQUALS` filter and a `NOT_EQUALS` filter on the same field. Combining filters in this way returns an error.
